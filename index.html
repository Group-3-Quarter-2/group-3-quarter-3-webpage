	<h2 style="font-family:monospace; color:white;"> 1.(Social Reform): Recommend social reforms that promote gender equality and challenge traditional gender roles. This could include changes in laws and policies.</h2>

<h2 style="font-family:monospace; color:white;">2. Women should be given opportunities to study and learn something to contribute to the economy aside from kinship roles as everyone should be given a chance to learn regardless of their gender.</h2>

<h2 style="font-family:monospace; color:white;">3. Promote the importance of gender equality: Spreading awareness and the importance of gender equality makes everyone see the disadvantages of INEQUALITY and the advantages of EQUALITY.</h2>
<h1 style="font-family:monospace; color:black; background-color:rgb(58, 188, 240); text-align:center;"> Final Solution </h1>
<h2 style="font-family:monospace; color:white;"> Our Final Solution is to Promote the importance of gender equality: <br>

<br> <br>The public should be informed about the importance and benefits of more gender equality. It's good for the economy, it makes communities healthier, it prevents violence against any female, and so much more. <br> <br>

Spreading awareness could be done by public campaigns and school programs.

<br> <br> And so we believe that spreading public awareness is the most effective way to prevent gender inequality during the Zhou dynasty.
